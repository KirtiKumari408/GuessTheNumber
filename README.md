# GuessTheNumber
Project Overview:
This is a Java-based project developed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship (Task 1). The project, titled "Guess the Number", is a fun and interactive game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a given range.

Features:-
*Random number generation between 1 and 100.
*Provides feedback to the user whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
*Limits the number of attempts to make the game more challenging.
*Allows multiple rounds of play.
*Displays a score at the end of the game.
*Awards points based on the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.

How to Play:-
*The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.
*The user enters their guess.

The system provides feedback:-
*"Too High" if the guess is greater than the random number.
*"Too Low" if the guess is less than the random number.
*"Correct!" when the user guesses the number.

The game continues until:-
*The user guesses the number correctly.
*The user exhausts the allowed number of attempts.

Technologies Used:-
*Programming Language: Java
*IDE: Any Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)

Result:-
This project is designed to enhance problem-solving and logical thinking. It demonstrates:

*Random number generation.
*User interaction through console inputs.
*Iterative loops and condition checks.
*Basic scoring and game logic.
